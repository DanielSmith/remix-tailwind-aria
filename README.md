# remix-tailwind-aria example

This is meant to be an example of using remix with tailwind and adobe react-aria components

They are from the tailwind styled examples at Adobe [react-aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html):

* [useDateRangePicker and useDatePicker](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useDateRangePicker.html)
* [useDateField](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useDateField.html)
* [useTimeField](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTimeField.html)
* [useTabList](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTabList.html)

The files in app/components are taken from codesandbox examples (that are referenced from the react-aria docs)

See app/routes/index.tsx for the example that ties things together.

This was quickly hacked together, as I wanted a reference of how to use the react-aria components for a project.  The components are from Devon Govett @ Adobe.  He has done a good job of writing examples that show how to use react-aria with Tailwind CSS.
                
## Development

The Remix dev server starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes. To start the Remix dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you should be ready to go!
